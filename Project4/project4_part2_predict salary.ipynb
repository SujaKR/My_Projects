    "#  Web Scraping for Indeed.com & Predicting Salaries\n",
    "This project is a test of three major skills: collecting data by scraping a website, using natural language processing, and building a binary classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of the project was focused on scraping Indeed.com. This notebook focused on using natural language processing and building models using job postings with salary information to predict salaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Collection:\n",
    "\n",
    "I used Beautiful soup to scrape the data from the site. I collected salary information for data analyst and data scientist jobs from Indeed. Then using the location, title, and summary of the job I attempted to predict the salary of the job. For job posting sites, this would be extraordinarily useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the challenge I faced during data collection is that not all job postings on Indeed have a salary listed. To work around this, I created a simple try/except statement to return 'NA' if there was no salary listed. Since I am trying to predict salaries, I had to filter my results down to only include the job postings that listed salaries.\n",
    "The next step was to compute the median salary of my results, which came out to be $100,000 and then I created a binary variable for each job - 1 if the salary was above the median and 0 if the salary was below the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models:\n",
    "\n",
    "I approached this as a classification problem and used Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest classifier. I predicted the Salary label as high or low based on the following parameters:\n",
    "Job Title, Job Location and Job Summary\n",
    "For the job title and job summary models, I used natural language processing to predict the salary class based on the various words that appeared.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to my analysis the following five cities were top in the chart in predicting the median salary:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Canberra ACT\t\n",
    "2. Sydney Central Business District NSW\t\n",
    "3. Sydney NSW\t\n",
    "4. Chatswood NSW\t\n",
    "5. Melbourne VIC\n",
    "My finding is that in Canberra most of the jobs are Contract and government jobs so the median price is higher than other cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the skills required for highly paid Data Analysts are good data analysis skills, good understanding of data,experience. And SQL knowledge is required in most of the jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the top Job Titles having high salary are as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Datahub data analyst              \n",
    "2. Senior data analyst                \n",
    "3. Lead data scientist                \n",
    "4. Audience data analyst              \n",
    "5. Digital  Data Analyst              \n",
    "6. Data analyst consultant \n",
    "\n",
    "As an employer which is a contracting company, the results can tell us how much a job candidate might be worth based on the role for which they are being hired and the skills that are required for that role. For example, a data analyst with proficient good data analysis skills might be paid more. As we can see from the result contract jobs are highly paid than permanent jobs which influence the model outcome.\n",
